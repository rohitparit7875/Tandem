Tandem language is not a single programming language. It refers to a set of programming languages and tools used on Tandem (now HPE) NonStop systems, which are designed for high availability, fault tolerance, and continuous operation—commonly used in banking, payments, telecom, and stock exchanges.
These systems are now officially called HPE NonStop.
